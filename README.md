### Problem Statement and Introduction
This section will describe the main objectives of the project and compare it with conventional methods of localisation and describe its advantages. This section will also explain the two main concept used in this project, i.e., **trilateration** and **RSSI** with diagrams and examples.
### Setup
This section will describe the physical setup of the project. There are three anchor nodes (microcontrollers) and a target node (mobile device), this section will explain how the anchor nodes use trilateration and the RSSI values of the sniffed packets to localise the target node.
### Distance Measurement and Path Loss Model
This section describes how the distance is measured accurately with the RSSI values and explains how to experimentally determine the relationship between the RSSI value and the distance at which the signal is received, also known as the path loss model.
### Results
This section describes the accuracy of the localisation method used in this project and compares it to accuracies of other localisation methods.
